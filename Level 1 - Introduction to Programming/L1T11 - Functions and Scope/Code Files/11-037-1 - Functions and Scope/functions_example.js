/* One way to make our code more efficient is to use functions. 
As you have read, a function is a block of code.
In the code above, we do two key tasks: 
1) Calculate the person's age, and 
2) Display the message. We can write reusable functions to achieve this.
We could write a function called 'calculateAge' as shown below.
The function needs to know the birth year, so we create a parameter called birthYear. */
